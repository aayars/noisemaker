Animaker CLI
============

Noisemaker includes a CLI utility called ``animaker`` that allows you to easily create animations from presets. See :doc:`artmaker` for the list of presets.

Running ``animaker`` without arguments generates a random 1024 x 1024 animation named ``ani.gif`` in the current directory.

For a more complete usage summary, run ``animaker -h`` or ``animaker --help``.
